                              <p>Rimworld is a colony management game driven by an intelligent storyteller. The character traits and behaviors are extremely diverse and they play amusingly with each other. I've played this game a bit but it's the sort that can and will suck your life away so I purposefully havent dove too far in yet. I would very much like to.</p>

                              <p>Skyrim is just about my favorite RPG of all time. I obsessively played it until there was nothing left to do, an impossible task. Considering Oblivion is its precursor, and is said to be better in just about every way but graphics, I would really like to play this game. I even have it. It's sitting on my bookshelf. Mocking me.</p>

                              <p>This game is set in Middle Earth, so it already has that going for it. I would play it for that even if it wasn't amazing. The main character is both a ranger <em>and</em> a wraith. These are my two favorite types of characters. The gameplay and graphics are amazing, and I'm practically drooling over this game, I just don't want to distract myself from school.</p>

                              Kingdom Hearts was the series that got me addicted to gaming in the first place. I started out with the Re:Coded game for the Nintendo DS and never looked back. I would play any and all of these games for the rest of my life and if the studio would stop taunting us with Kingdom Hearts III I would be a very happy person.
