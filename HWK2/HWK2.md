# Homework 2

[Repository](https://github.com/jhammett15/jhammett15.github.io) | [Demo](https://jhammett15.github.io/HWK2/HoursNeeded.html)

In homework 2 we took what we did from Homework 1 and added javascript. We needed to create a webpage with css (either adding to the one from HWK1 or creating a new one) and have jquery (a library of javascript) modify the page based on user input. 

## Planning & Design

I decided to add a page onto my website from Homework 1. This way I already had the css styling and a theme for what the web page should do. For the content, I decided on a "calculator" that would tell approximately how many hours it would take to complete a game according to what type of game it was, whether it was open world or not, and whether it had any DLC.

I figured it would look something like this.
