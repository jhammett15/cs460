# Homework 1 

This was the first homework for CS 460: Software Engineering, in which we learned the basics of HTML and CSS through creating a simple website. We used Bootstrap for our base library, which is a popular CSS and Javascript library for page layouts. 

We used the command line version of Git as a means of version control, linked to a remote repository on Github.

## Git setup

Our first task was to download and install the command line version of Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

I had never used git before, so there was a bit of a learning curve, but the basics were well explained in class. I did all of my work on a Windows machine, but used the Git Bash terminal for all of the version control, which uses Linux commands.

It probably would have been easier to create the repository on Github and then clone it to my local machine, but I created the initial repository on my laptop, so I linked my machine to Github, then pushed everything there to link the two.

```
 git remote add origin https://github.com/jhammett15/cs460.git
 git remote -v
 origin  https://github.com/jhammett15/cs460.git (fetch)
 origin  https://github.com/jhammett15/cs460.git (push)
```

At this point I hadn't created any files, I only had an empty folder.

## Webpage

I learned the basics of HTML several years ago, so I knew about opening and closing tags, but that was about it for my experience. I didn't remember anything about CSS other than that it was used for styling, and I didn't know what Bootstrap was at all.
