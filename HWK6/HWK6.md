# Homework 6

[Repository](https://github.com/jhammett15/jhammett15.github.io) 

The goal of this project was to show that we can connect to a pre-existing large database and use portions of it to build a web-based application. We made a single website with two features: the ability to find people by searching their name (either full or partial) and returning their information, and to return company and purchase history information if the person searched was a customer.

## Setting up the Project

The first step after creating my base project files was to download the database and extract the files. I first downloaded the zip file of the git repository where the sln file was stored. Once that was done I opened the wwi-sample.sln in the world-wide-importers folder and built the solution. I then right-clicked on the WorldWideImporters project, clicked publish, and set the target database connection to my SQL Server Management Studio connection. I changed the name of the database to be created there to WorldWideImporters and clicked publish.
