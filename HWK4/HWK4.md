# Homework 4

[Repository](https://github.com/jhammett15/jhammett15.github.io) 

The task for homework 4 was to create an MVC project to demonstrate simple server-side logic. We demonstrated the basics of GET and POST commands, as well as query strings, form data, and input validation. We did this through the creation of two pages: a mile converter which took in a mile number and converted it to one of many other measurements, and a color chooser which took in two colors and added their hexadecimal values together and displayed a third color.
