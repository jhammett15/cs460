        <h2>Mile to Metric Converter</h2>
        <p>
            Want to know how many millimeters there are in 26.2 miles? This calculator is for you. Uses query strings to send form data to
            the server, which performs the calculation and returns the answer in the requested page.

        <h2>Color Chooser</h2>
        <p>
            Typical online color choosers are way too useful. We wanted something fun and completely useless. This form POSTs the data to the
            server.
