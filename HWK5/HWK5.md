# Homework 5

[Repository](https://github.com/jhammett15/jhammett15.github.io) 

The goal of this homework was to create a database-backed web application using ASP.NET MVC 5. This would take the form of a maintenance request form. To begin with I was to write the T-SQL necessary to create and populate a simple one-table database. The first page would be the request form. The user would fill out the fields and when submitted the data would be stored in a local database. The second part of the project was to create a table populated with the data from this database. I did this through the use of T-SQL
