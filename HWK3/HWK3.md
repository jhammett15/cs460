# Homework 2

The task for Homework 3 was to translate a program from Java to C#. This program was a binary number generator. It took in an integer greater than one in decimal and output a list of binary numbers from one up to that number. We were to do this in Microsoft Visual Studio. I had used neither this nor C# before.

## Download Visual Studio

You can download Visual Studio [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). It was a bit intimidating at first because there were so many buttons. Figuring out which kind of project I needed to create in the first place was probably the most difficult part. Once that was done it was fairly easy, Visual Studio autogenerates the basic starting code that you need. 

## Translating the Node class

The Node class was very straightforward to translade, the syntax for C# and Java matched up exactly, the only differences in the files is the using statements at the top of the C# file, and the naming conventions. In C#, field names are capitalized whereas in Java they aren't.
